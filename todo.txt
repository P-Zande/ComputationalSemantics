Preprocessing:
- Handle structures where a token is one level lower than the previous token, eg:
fa
 fa
  t
  t
 t

- Handle multiple verbnet labels on one token, e.g. pmb-4.0.0/data/en/gold/p03/d0766/
  The second label can continue on the currentTokenWithVerbnet of the first label I think, as it can only be applied after the first label has been applied.



data/en/gold/p00/d0055 : There becomes agent, but it shouldn't be semantically. Ask Johan how the assignment works here.
